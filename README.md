## Titanic Machine Learning

This is a project that uses Jupyter to analyse datasets from the infamous Titanic tragedy of 1912. The goal is to use a Kaggle-designed workflow to train a machine to accurately guess which people survived the sinking based on available data on the passengers. I am using this as a way to understand the basics of machine learning and data science with Python.
